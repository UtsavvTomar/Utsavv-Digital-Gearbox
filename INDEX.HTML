                <li>The coventional gearboxes are designed and controlled manually in almost all the industrial applications.</li><br>
                <li>Monitoring gearboxes for efficient working and maintenance requires lots of skill, labour and cost to maintain it.</li><br>
                <li>For the purpose of experimental investigation we have to collect the vibration signal for different external load values, as the gearbox with faulty gear is more vulnerable to external load than the gearbox in healthy condition.</li><br>
                <li>The complex rotating machine such a gearboxes which are an integral part of power transmission among various machines pose a challenge in deriving the health monitoring strategies, firstly, due to their highly non linear non stationery behaviour.</li><br>
                <li>Secondly, due to the dynamics of material, loads and speeds it involves as a result of direct and indirect interaction of various subsystems and components. Thirdly, it is very difficult to obtain the real time sensor data at specific location due to the continuous rotating nature of the system and therefore the sensors are placed somewhere near to stationery locations.</li>

                <li>In this project, there is provision of remotely observing the current, voltage, power factor and speed of the Gearbox, switching on or off of the Gearbox and changing the speed of the Gearbox; all through the webpage</li><br>
                <li>This project is microcontroller based and is easily controllable.
